# Overview

This repository contains historical data sets for Halo Infinite match times, as captured from the **United States west coast**.

While the data is not necessarily capturing the _global_ wait times, it can be used as a reasonable reference point for wait times for various playlists available through each of the Halo Infinite operations since the start of tracking on the OpenSpartan side.
