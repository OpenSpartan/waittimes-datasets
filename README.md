# Overview

This repository contains historical data sets for Halo Infinite match times, as captured from the **United States west coast**.

While the data is not necessarily capturing the _global_ wait times, it can be used as a reasonable reference point for wait times for various playlists available through each of the Halo Infinite operations since the start of tracking on the OpenSpartan side.

## Analyzing the data

Every single dataset available in this repository is a [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/). You can query it from any language or framework that supports SQLite, and even make pretty graphs with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

There are two tables in each datasets:

| Table | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `PlaylistMetadata`  | Outlines all playlist-related metadata, including playlist asset ID, version ID, name, description, and more. |
| `WaitTimeSnapshots` | Captures playlist wait times, in 10 minute intervals. Data includes snapshot timestamp (PT time zone), asset ID, version ID, and wait time in seconds. |

You can also analyze the data with the help of a tool like [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
